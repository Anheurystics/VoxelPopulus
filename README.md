# VoxelPopulus
Voxel Populus is a web-based 3D building sandbox, written using WebGL. For now, it allows you to fly arund and to place and remove blocks. (Initial block can't be removed due to obvious reasons)

The world also saves and loads automatically, and it uses your browser's localStorage to do so.
